# Shopping Cart

- Live Demo

## Objective

To create a mock shopping website with a shopping cart to practice routing, testing, and using CSS modules. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).

**Requirements**

1. The website should have at least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes the shopping cart)
 - User should be able to navigate between pages via the navigation bar, which is shown on both pages
2. The home page can have anything you want
3. The shopping cart page should have the same navigation bar with a shopping cart button that also displays the number of items currently in cart
 - Clicking on the button should take the user to the checkout page (but we won't be implementing the checkout logic)
4. Build individual card elements for each product. The card should display an input field that allows the user to type a quantity, an increment and a decrement button to fine-tune the quantity, and an "Add to Cart" button
5. Fetch shop items from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) or something similar
6. Once a user has added an item to their cart, the number of items in the cart should be adjusted accordingly
7. Test the app thoroughly using the React Testing Library
8. Style the application
